# Check out this timer

- The timer is setup to be centered on the bottom of the screen when in 
fullscreen mode

- Type "f" to check it out

---

# How it works

- I use the `countdown` package to create the timer in a separate HTML
document<sup>1</sup>

- I then import the timer in the YAML front matter of my xaringan slides

- The time is set to countdown from 20 minutes, the typical duration of an 
academic presentation in my field

# Try it

- To include the timer in your `xaringan` presentations add the following 
to your YAML front matter: 

```yaml
output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    includes:
      after_body: timer.html
```
